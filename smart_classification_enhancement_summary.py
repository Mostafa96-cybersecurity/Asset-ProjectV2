üöÄ SMART CLASSIFICATION ENHANCEMENT 
===================================

This enhancement specifically addresses the "Unknown Device" issue by:
1. Improving classification scoring algorithms
2. Better fallback mechanisms
3. More comprehensive device signatures
4. Enhanced pattern recognition

Key improvements:
- Lower confidence threshold with smarter scoring
- Enhanced hostname pattern analysis
- Better service detection
- Smart fallback classification
