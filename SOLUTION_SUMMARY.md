## 🎯 HOW TO USE THE SOLUTIONS

### **1. Web Service Management**
```python
# All buttons now work properly:
- Click "🚀 Start Web Service" → Service starts on port 8080
- Click "⏹️ Stop Web Service" → Service stops gracefully
- Click "🔄 Restart Web Service" → Service restarts properly
- Click "🌐 Open in Browser" → Opens http://localhost:8080
```

### **2. Scheduled Scan Monitoring**
```python
# Monitor scheduled scans:
- Status shows: "🟢 Running: Daily Full Scan" or "🔴 Idle"
- Progress shows: "Progress: 45% - 12 devices found"
- Next scan shows: "Next: Hourly Quick Scan at 2025-10-02 17:00"
```

### **3. Comprehensive Logging**
```python
# View logs:
- "📋 View All Logs" → Shows all system logs
- "🌐 Web Service Logs" → Shows web service specific logs
- "🔍 Scan Logs" → Shows scanning activity logs
- "📤 Export Logs" → Exports logs to JSON file
```

## 📊 MONITORING DASHBOARD

The new monitoring section shows:

### **⏰ Scheduled Scanning Status**
- Current scan status (Running/Idle)
- Progress percentage and devices found
- Next scheduled scan time

### **🔧 Feature Status Overview**
