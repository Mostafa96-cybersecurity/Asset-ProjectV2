## 🖥️ **HOW TO USE YOUR NEW AUTOMATION SYSTEM**

### **Option 1: Using Your Existing Launcher (Recommended)**
```batch
# Your original launcher should now work:
Asset_Management_System.bat
```
This will launch `enhanced_complete_web_service.py` which we created.

### **Option 2: Direct Desktop Application**
```bash
# Enhanced desktop app with automation:
python launch_enhanced_desktop.py
```

### **Option 3: GUI Only (Alternative)**
```bash
# Original GUI with new automation features:
python gui_automation_launcher.py
```
